    "text": "Environmental Data Gaps\nGenerally, environmental data is temporally and geographically limited, which renders it less effective in informing policy decisions. In Information as Power: Democratizing Environmental Data3, Dr. Annie Brett emphasizes the importance of long-term, integrated national environmental data. She writes:\n\"Yes, new technologies are generating new data on environmental conditions. But systemic challenges throughout the data lifecycle prevent this data from being used effectively to inform decision-making. Data is often redundant, inaccessible, and unavailable to key stakeholders.\"\n\nWithout reliable, long-term environmental data, it is difficult to study long term trends that could inform government climate action. Brett's proposed solution to these environmental data gaps is for federal agencies to maintain long term, accessible environmental data in integrated databases. \nThanks to the Clean Water Act, water quality data comprises some of the United States' most reliable environmental datasets, but water quality is still impacted by temporal and geographic data gaps. \n\n\nCase Study: Nitrogen Data\nIn Closing the Environmental Data Gap 4, Robin O'Malley et al. provide a case study on nitrogen pollution, demonstrating the impacts of insufficient environmental data. Nitrogen is released into the environment by fossil fuels, fertilizers, and sewage. Nitrogen in runoff leads to well-documented coastal dead zones, and can cause health problems for children if present in drinking water. There are vast geographic gaps in nitrogen pollution data, making it difficult to mitigate the effects of this pollution, and to quantify measures of success in this mitigation. If we are not able to quantify nitrogen pollution and the environmental parameters it affects, how can we craft policy to create positive change in an increasingly data-driven world? How will we know if our policy change has been effective without reliable, widespread environmental data? \n\n\nCitizen Science\nCitizen Science (CS) is becoming an increasingly useful source of environmental data. CS requires relatively little funding while increasing the scale of data collection and involving the community in the first step of modern environmental decision-making. \nCS also requires open data to encourage continued volunteer participation. 83% of citizen science projects studied by Alex de Sherbinin et al. in The Critical Importance of Citizen Science Data5 shared the data with the volunteers. \nCommunity members are arguably the most important stakeholders in environmental issues, and by including citizens in data collection and environmental decision-making, we can move towards overcoming environmental justice issues. \nContrary to popular belief, CS can be a very reliable source of data. The vast majority of projects studied in Sherbinin et al. 20215 had strong methods for ensuring data quality- 94% of projects used one method or more. \n\nThat being said, Citizen Science does not solve all of our environmental data issues. Depending on the scale, CS does not always resolve the need for large-scale, cohesive datasets. CS also raises issues of equity; it is a privilege to have free time and resources to volunteer as a citizen scientist. \n\n\nCase Study: The Santa Barbara Channelkeeper\nThe Santa Barbara Channelkeeper's (SBCK) Stream Team Program6 on California's Central Coast is one successful example of citizen science in water quality data collection. Volunteers, accompanied by trained staff, measure key water quality parameters in dozens of streams in the Santa Barbara area. Local government agencies regularly use this data to inform policy decisions. This data has been used to identify pollution hot spots, which SBCK and local governments collaboratively restored. \nThere are several key aspects of this program that contribute to its accuracy and its success in engaging the community in watershed management:\n\nSBCK sends a trained staff member with each volunteer group to ensure proper data collection. This is known to improve the accuracy of citizen science data.5\nSBCK provides transportation to measurement sites, which greatly reduces the financial burden on volunteers and expands the potential reach of this volunteer program. \nSBCK treats volunteers to a free lunch following the sampling events. This provides some form of compensation to volunteers, which many citizen science volunteer programs do not. \nData collected by SBCK is publicly available for download in .csv format, and data can be explored directly on their website without any programming experience.7\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGitelman, Lisa. \"Raw Data\" is an Oxymoron.

    "text": "As an undergraduate at UCSB, I was a board member and a mentor for the new Earth Science department mentoring program (GEMSS). Here, I organized community events and panels focused on academic and professional development and received the Departmental Leadership Award for my efforts. \nI am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB. I am interested in the confluence of data science and water quality. I have held water quality monitoring roles at the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration, Valley Water, and the Santa Barbara Channelkeeper. In these positions, I developed expertise in field hydrology, specifically surface water quality and its impact on the surrounding environment. Moving forward, I hope to continue collecting and analyzing hydrological data to find solutions to water resources issues."
